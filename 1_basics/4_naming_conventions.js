/**
 * Naming Conventions 2
 * 1) camelCase - first character is lowercase and start letter after words is captial ex) getFirstClass
 *  - almost every language uses this rule
 * 2) snake_case - words are binded with '_' using no captial (python)
 * 3) PascalCase - camelCase but first word is also capital ex) PanCake (C#, nicrosoft) - don't use this style
 * 4) For JS, use only capital for const variable.
